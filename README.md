# SNHU-CS-250

Throughout my lessons and during this course one of the things we heavily explored was the concept and execution of User Stories. To which at the start I didn't
think too much of till slowly but surely they would become one of my favorite things in programming. User Stories for someone like me personally help me 
out alot in the long run as they are able to provide a quick and easy what needs to be done instead of a list of instructions that could be interpreted
either in a wrong way or not including enough information, or the other side and including too much information that it becomes severely overwhelming. 

With User Stories we are able to see what the program needs, wants and how it should be done. From simply asking to set up controls that will call to 
change an image in a slideshow as shown in another project we have worked on too communicating with an API to get a list directly from the internet. User Stories
communicate with the end user themself to provide a product that an end user will want to use, not just a programmer. This includes factors such as quality of life,
attractiveness of the programs end display and of course if the program works in the way it needs to be. User stories themselves are an amazing way to get down to 
brass tacks when it comes to communicating the needs of the end user.
